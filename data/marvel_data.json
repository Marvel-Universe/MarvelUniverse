They learned super heroes are merely biological antibodies to protect a growing embryo within the Earth. An embryo for the Celestial race: This is the way these Gods fought back - only to cause a terrible ecological imbalance, a rift at its core that in time would wipe out all life on the planet. In UNIVERSE X, Captain Marvel was reborn on Earth years after his death. But he also still claimed to walk in the realm of the unliving, where Earth's fallen champions still exist. Mar-Vell led a team of heroes in a quest for the greatest weapons of mass destruction on Earth, suggesting this would limit the destruction caused by the growing power struggle on the planet. But this was not the only reason. For his crusade on Earth only supported and armed a battle he fought in the realm of the fallen, a battle against Death herself. Those living champions who died in his collection of artifacts were added to the battle raging in this other realm. Mar-Vell led a charge against Death and killed her. But now that Death is dead, no one will ever die again. They may writhe in pain in hospitals because their bodies have been broken beyond repair, but they will not die. They will call out for an end to their suffering. They will cry out for peace but there will be no answer. Paradise will be denied them. Yes. Death is truly dead. Long live the living.

Her powers were unremarkable compared to the amazing abilities of the costumed icons that populate the Marvel Universe. In a city of Marvels, Jessica Jones never found her niche. Now a chain-smoking, self-destructive alcoholic with a mean inferiority complex, Jones is the owner and sole employee of Alias Investigations - a small, private-investigative firm specializing in super-human cases. In her inaugural arc, Jessica's life immediately becomes expendable when she uncovers the potentially explosive secret of one hero's true identity. But her wit, charm and intelligence just may help her survive through another day. Thrust into the midst of a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels, has Jessica burned too many bridges to turn to old friends for help? Plus: Jessica travels to upstate New York to investigate the disappearance of a teenage girl rumored to be a mutant in a prejudiced small town, goes on a date with the Astonishing Ant-Man, teams up with Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman; and confronts the demons of her past! Collects Alias #1-28, What If? Jessica Jones had Joined the Avengers.",

But what appeared to be a black-and-white situation quickly turns a murky shade of gray, and Reed Richards and his family find themselves besieged on all sides - both by those they thought of as their allies, and by the very people they are trying to save. And in the awful aftermath of their authoritative action, three of the Four must contend with the defenses of the afterlife - and storm the gates of Heaven itself to rescue a fallen teammate. They've faced Galactus, the destroyer of everything. Now, they face the creator of everything, as the FF are reunited in the hereafter. Plus: The Fantastic Four have a lot to answer for - and when you're trying to regain the trust of cynical New Yorkers, is associating with a certain misunderstood wall-crawler really a wise move?

In 1961, writer Stan Lee penned FANTASTIC FOUR #1, an historic issue unlike any comic book that had come before. This super-hero team had true personalities - they doubted their own abilities, battled problems of money and illness, and even fought among themselves. The monumental popularity of this realistic comic-book style inspired Lee to create similarly themed titles - including HULK, X-MEN and AVENGERS with artist Jack Kirby; and AMAZING SPIDER-MAN with artist Steve Ditko. By 1965, Lee had successfully established Marvel Comics as a cohesive universe populated by world-famous comic-book characters. Now, this deluxe keepsake edition collects his greatest moments - some never before reprinted:\r<br>โ€ข \"Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge,\" CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #3, Stan's first story, a two-page text piece!\r<br>โ€ข \"The Red Skull's Deadly Revenge,\" CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #16, the defining Golden Age Red Skull story!\r<br>โ€ข \"The Raving Madman,\" SUSPENSE #29, Stan's satire on Frederick Wertham and the comics witch-hunts of the '50s!\r<br>โ€ข \"Where Walks the Ghost,\" AMAZING ADULT FANTASY #11, a short, twist-ending story by Lee and Ditko!\r<br>Plus: \"Spider-Man,\" AMAZING FANTASY #15; \"A Visit With the Fantastic Four,\" FANTASTIC FOUR #11; \"How Stan and Steve Create Spider-Man,\" AMAZING SPIDER-MAN ANNUAL #1; \"In Mortal Combat with Sub-Mariner,\" DAREDEVIL #7; \"Bedlam in the Baxter Building,\" FANTASTIC FOUR ANNUAL #3; \"And Who Shall Mourn for Him?\" SILVER SURFER #5; \"Brother, Take My Hand,\" DAREDEVIL #47; \"And Now, The Goblin,\" \"In the Grip of the Goblin,\" \"The Goblin's Last Stand,\" AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #96-98; \"No More the Thunder God,\" \"When Gods Go Mad,\" \"One God Must Fall,\" THOR #179-181; \"While the World Spins Mad,\" MARVEL PREMIERE #3; and \"The Cycle of Life,\" SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN SUPER-SPECIAL 1995!\r<br>",

He has revived countless fellow Norse gods, from the brave Balder to the voluminous Volstagg to the treacherous Loki. But what of Odin, the All-Father? Where is the lion of Norse legend, the son of Bor, the one who took a godhood of rambunctious rabble-rousers and made of them a pantheon without peer? Why is he yet to be awakened? The answer is a secret known only by the God of Thunder - a secret buried deep inside a soul filled with the kind of fear and humiliation only a son can feel in the immense shadow of his father. Though, as Loki's master plan will soon attest, Thor is not the only one with a secret to share. Collecting THOR #7-12; #600\r\nRated T  ...$19.99 \t\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-1760-5",

And if fighting the Herald of Galactusโ€” a man who literally has the Power Cosmic at his disposal โ€” isnโ€t enough, Doreenโ€s got other problems to deal with, including intergalactic scam artists, Drax the Destroyer and LOKI LAUFEYSON. FEEL the thrill of the fight! SEE it happen, via artisanally selected images and words juxtaposed in deliberate sequence! HEAR the words in your head via your inner voice as you read them, which when you think about it is kind of weird! All we have to do is write down words on a piece of paper, and suddenly theyโ€re re-created in your mind exactly as we intended. Minds are crazy, and language is EVEN CRAZIER. Anyway, please enjoy this comic about a girl and her talking squirrel in space.",

Collecting INCREDIBLE HULK #609-611 and INCREDIBLE HULK #312.",

Enter the Universal Inhumans, alien beings engineered by the Kree on other worlds just as they created the Inhumans on Earth โ€” our heroesโ€ brothers and sisters in the stars! Unfortunately, sometimes brothers and sisters fight. Plus: Their name means โ€genocide.โ€ But what exactly are the Inhuman-possessing Skyspears? Can our crew find out before the Snark War begins? The secrets of the Prima Materia, the original Terrigen, will be revealed at last. But it has been foretold that of the seven royals who left Earth, only six will return โ€” and that prophecy is about to be fulfilled!",

Assuming his late father's identity, he began a descent into madness that would haunt him his entire life; only in death could he finally find peace.

He was once known as Rampage-when he combated the classic Los Angeles superteam The Champions. He was once a weapons designer for Sunset Bain-when he designed the War Machine armor. And he ended up a prisoner on The Raft-one that escaped during The Breakout. The two constants in his completely insane life have been his absolute brilliance, and his utter hatred of Tony Stark. And now, in his way, he too is a victim of Frank Castle...Take a look inside the life and times of this very special madman, courtesy of Matt Fraction (THE IMMORTAL IRON FIST, THE ORDER, CASANOVA) and Howard Chaykin (Wolverine, Howard Chakin's American Flagg!)\r<br>Rated T+ ...$2.99 \r<br>",

How many have drawn blood with my sword?\" Millionaire industrialist Tony Stark is an inventive genius who has dedicated all of his enormous financial and intellectual resources to a single guiding principle: the creation of technology for the betterment of humanity. Stark's greatest creation is a modern-day miracle: a suit of form-fitting, strength-enhancing, steel-mesh armor he dons to become the living symbol of his ideals, the Invincible Iron Man! But when Stark discovers that the same technology he used to create the Iron Man armor - technology so secret he didn't even dare patent it - is now in the hands of several deadly super-villains, he feels responsible for the evil they have done with the high-tech tools he unwittingly provided. In the face of objections from his government, friends, colleagues and fellow super heroes, Stark swears to use the power of Iron Man to bring the evil to an end - and to take back what's his. The Beatle, Stilt Man, the Controller, Stingray, the Mandroids, the Guardsmen and Firepower don't know it yet, but they've got a problem. The world's most powerful force for good isn't playing by the rules anymore. And he's coming for them. Collecting IRON MAN #225-232.\r\n208 PGS./Rated A ...$24.99",

Marc Spector was a soldier. A mercenary. A killer. And now, thanks to Moon Knight, he's a dead man. But the avatar of Khonshu lives on in the form of Jake Lockley - a more laid-back personality who just wants to take a nice, relaxing trip in Mexico. But for him, this means bashing his way through bare-knuckle-fighting tournaments, hiring on for a \"snatch and grab\" on behalf of a rich and well-armed land baron, and going toe-to-toe with a guy named Frank Castle - who the criminal element knows better as the Punisher. AAA never recommended a trip like this, but then again, Moon Knight is no ordinary tourist! Collecting MOON KNIGHT #26-30.\r\nParental Advisory ...$15.99",
