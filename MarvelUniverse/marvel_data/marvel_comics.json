They learned super heroes are merely biological antibodies to protect a growing embryo within the Earth. An embryo for the Celestial race: This is the way these Gods fought back - only to cause a terrible ecological imbalance, a rift at its core that in time would wipe out all life on the planet. In UNIVERSE X, Captain Marvel was reborn on Earth years after his death. But he also still claimed to walk in the realm of the unliving, where Earth's fallen champions still exist. Mar-Vell led a team of heroes in a quest for the greatest weapons of mass destruction on Earth, suggesting this would limit the destruction caused by the growing power struggle on the planet. But this was not the only reason. For his crusade on Earth only supported and armed a battle he fought in the realm of the fallen, a battle against Death herself. Those living champions who died in his collection of artifacts were added to the battle raging in this other realm. Mar-Vell led a charge against Death and killed her. But now that Death is dead, no one will ever die again. They may writhe in pain in hospitals because their bodies have been broken beyond repair, but they will not die. They will call out for an end to their suffering. They will cry out for peace but there will be no answer. Paradise will be denied them. Yes. Death is truly dead. Long live the living.

And they'll ride out that flame with one of the most influential X-Men stories of all-\"Days of Future Past!\"\r<br>Feared, hated and now on the road to extinction, Marvel's Children of the Atom face a bleak future of mutant concentration camps and a world where heroes are a thing of days gone past. Only by leaping back through time can Kitty Pryde's future self hope to stop the events that created this dystopian nightmare!\r<br>Claremont and Byrne close out their classic run together with a fan-favorite Kitty Pryde holiday tale, but things only pick up from there with the return of the man who first delineated the all-new, all-different X-Men-Dave Cockrum! \r<br>Cockrum and Claremont put their team in a slow-pressure cooker with Arcade, Dr. Doom, Garokk and then blows its top with the return of Magneto in a double-sized anniversary extravaganza!

Regarded as the most innovative thinker of the current comic-book renaissance, Morrison proceeded to turn the mutant-hero genre on its ear. Gone were the gaudy spandex costumes - replaced by slick, black leather and an attitude to match. Now, his entire Eisner Award-nominated run on NEW X-MEN is collected in one deluxe hardcover!

They've faced Galactus, the destroyer of everything. Now, they face the creator of everything, as the FF are reunited in the hereafter.

In 1961, writer Stan Lee penned FANTASTIC FOUR #1, an historic issue unlike any comic book that had come before. This super-hero team had true personalities - they doubted their own abilities, battled problems of money and illness, and even fought among themselves. The monumental popularity of this realistic comic-book style inspired Lee to create similarly themed titles - including HULK, X-MEN and AVENGERS with artist Jack Kirby; and AMAZING SPIDER-MAN with artist Steve Ditko. By 1965, Lee had successfully established Marvel Comics as a cohesive universe populated by world-famous comic-book characters. Now, this deluxe keepsake edition collects his greatest moments - some never before reprinted:\r<br>\u2022 \"Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge,\" CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #3, Stan's first story, a two-page text piece!\r<br>\u2022 \"The Red Skull's Deadly Revenge,\" CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #16, the defining Golden Age Red Skull story!\r<br>\u2022 \"The Raving Madman,\" SUSPENSE #29, Stan's satire on Frederick Wertham and the comics witch-hunts of the '50s!\r<br>\u2022 \"Where Walks the Ghost,\" AMAZING ADULT FANTASY #11, a short, twist-ending story by Lee and Ditko!\r<br>Plus: \"Spider-Man,\" AMAZING FANTASY #15; \"A Visit With the Fantastic Four,\" FANTASTIC FOUR #11; \"How Stan and Steve Create Spider-Man,\" AMAZING SPIDER-MAN ANNUAL #1; \"In Mortal Combat with Sub-Mariner,\" DAREDEVIL #7; \"Bedlam in the Baxter Building,\" FANTASTIC FOUR ANNUAL #3; \"And Who Shall Mourn for Him?\" SILVER SURFER #5; \"Brother, Take My Hand,\" DAREDEVIL #47; \"And Now, The Goblin,\" \"In the Grip of the Goblin,\" \"The Goblin's Last Stand,\" AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #96-98; \"No More the Thunder God,\" \"When Gods Go Mad,\" \"One God Must Fall,\" THOR #179-181; \"While the World Spins Mad,\" MARVEL PREMIERE #3; and \"The Cycle of Life,\" SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN SUPER-SPECIAL 1995!\r<br>",

With super-sized conflict within the team and colossal menaces without, the drama made every issue a nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat extravaganza.

        "description": "Man, Thor, Giant-Man and the Wasp with a trio of former super villains, readers thought he'd gone mad. As it turned out, the only thing crazy about the adventures of Earth's Mightiest Heroes was how insanely exciting the lineup of Captain America, Hawkeye, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch became! With super-sized conflict within the team and colossal menaces without, the drama made every issue a nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat extravaganza. Classic stories including battles with Kang the Conqueror, Doctor Doom, Power Man and the Enchantress, and Attuma will prove that the Avengers are the world's preeminent heroes - while revelations like Captain America's departure will test the team at its most fundamental level. But it won't just be Cap's Kooky Quartet against the world forever. In these pages, you'll see also the return of Giant-Man and the Wasp, and Hank Pym's transformation into Goliath! And with the first appearances of the Collector, the Swordsman and the Sons of the Serpent - not to mention the entrance of the Black Widow into the Avengers' world - there's no questioning this collection's a MARVEL MASTERWORKS! Collecting AVENGERS #21-30.",

He has revived countless fellow Norse gods, from the brave Balder to the voluminous Volstagg to the treacherous Loki. But what of Odin, the All-Father? Where is the lion of Norse legend, the son of Bor, the one who took a godhood of rambunctious rabble-rousers and made of them a pantheon without peer? Why is he yet to be awakened? The answer is a secret known only by the God of Thunder - a secret buried deep inside a soul filled with the kind of fear and humiliation only a son can feel in the immense shadow of his father. Though, as Loki's master plan will soon attest, Thor is not the only one with a secret to share. Collecting THOR #7-12; #600\r\nRated T  ...$19.99 \t\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-1760-5",

In contrast, Harry had always wilted under life's pressures and the strain of his father's domineering influence, unable to live up to Norman's expectations.

Witnessing Norman's apparent death in battle with Spider-Man, Harry was driven to the brink of insanity. Assuming his late father's identity, he began a descent into madness that would haunt him his entire life; only in death could he finally find peace.

In WEAPON X, acclaimed writer/illustrator Barry Windsor-Smith peels back this veil of secrecy to reveal how Wolverine's skeleton became laced with an indestructible adamantium metal.

As he battles back against this tortuous experience, Wolverine proves himself to be a true hero long before his days as an X-Man.",

        "description": "\"How many? How many have drawn blood with my sword?\" Millionaire industrialist Tony Stark is an inventive genius who has dedicated all of his enormous financial and intellectual resources to a single guiding principle: the creation of technology for the betterment of humanity. Stark's greatest creation is a modern-day miracle: a suit of form-fitting, strength-enhancing, steel-mesh armor he dons to become the living symbol of his ideals, the Invincible Iron Man! But when Stark discovers that the same technology he used to create the Iron Man armor - technology so secret he didn't even dare patent it - is now in the hands of several deadly super-villains, he feels responsible for the evil they have done with the high-tech tools he unwittingly provided. In the face of objections from his government, friends, colleagues and fellow super heroes, Stark swears to use the power of Iron Man to bring the evil to an end - and to take back what's his. The Beatle, Stilt Man, the Controller, Stingray, the Mandroids, the Guardsmen and Firepower don't know it yet, but they've got a problem. The world's most powerful force for good isn't playing by the rules anymore. And he's coming for them. Collecting IRON MAN #225-232.\r\n208 PGS./Rated A ...$24.99",

Dark forces are destroying everything mystical in the Multiverse, and their sights are set on this dimension. The Empirikul are coming. Magic's days are numbered. And Doctor Strange is not ready!
